PMouse
Enables the use of touch devices as tablets for computers.

Dependencies:
python (2.6)
node.js -> coffeescript -> zappa for static server

To Run:
If running on a mac, be sure to use the built in python (/usr/bin/python) for system event support
$ py26 mousesocket.py
$ coffee client/static_server.coffee
On your tablet visit CO.MPU.TER.IP:5003

On the tablet the color of the background indicates network state:
grey - waiting
red - failed socket
green - happy

Gestures:
one finger - move mouse
second finger touch - left mouse button
third finger touch - right mouse button

Security:
None to speak of.
If your mouse starts moving of its own volition, close the laptop and reopen in a network free zone (microwave?) to terminate the python server.

This has only been tested with OSX 10.6 and an old iPad.
In the real of the theoretical, it should 'just work' with any OS and touch enabled web device.
